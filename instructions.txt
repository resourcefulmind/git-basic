Well so this is just me deciding to take coding a little more seriously than ever because i just realized there is a lot of potential in me and i intend to maxiize that potential to the fullest. The country's economy has failed since and so what do you want a young tech guy who is jsut starting his journey to do?

No light to even try coding for long hours and still on still i have to make it out of here and bring up my fam too.

But being from the hood has prepared me for these times. So we just keep it quiet and keep it moving around here. Making money is the goal
